Hello world, Iâ€™m Oliver Selinger. ðŸ‘‹  
I am a data scientist at heart and have a strong background in both renewable energy management and bioinformatics.
Currently, I am employed as head of the department "Bioinformatics" at BioCopy GmbH, a German startup that provides high-throughput analyses for the development of immunotherapeutics and novel vaccines in the field of oncology and infectious diseases.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in exciting small scale projects to further hone my programming skills and to try out new ideas. I am focussing my work on data science and machine learning for data science using Python. 

You can reach me via LinkedIn (Oliver Selinger-Lutz) if you really want to ðŸ“«
